This repository contains the scripts used for building LessLinux. They are not complete yet since I am cleaning up during the move from subversion to git. See the documentation on http://blog.lesslinux.org/ for details.

**Building the Toolchain**

Scripts for the toolchain reside in stage01. This basically builds cross compile tools that are native to the host architecture. It is later used to chroot to. For details read http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter05/introduction.html.

To build, simply run: 

`ruby -I. builder.rb -n -l -s 2,3`

This skips the second and third stage, logs and runs no tests.

**Building packages in chroot**

Now packages in the chroot have to be build. LessLinux supports parallel builds (`-t`) and dependency tracking using strace. If you are not adding new packages, turn it off.

To build, simply run: 

`ruby -I. builder.rb -n -l -s 1,3 -t 3 --no-stracalyze`
