This repository contains the scripts used for building LessLinux. They are not complete yet since I am cleaning up during the move from subversion to git. See the documentation on http://blog.lesslinux.org/ for details. 

**Building the Toolchain**

Scripts for the toolchain reside in stage01. This basically builds cross compile tools that are native to the host architecture. It is later used to chroot to. For details read http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter05/introduction.html.

To build, simply run: 

`ruby -I. builder.rb -n -l -s 2,3`

This skips the second and third stage, logs and runs no tests. If you want to build the unstable tree, use:

`ruby -I. builder.rb -n -l -s 2,3 -u`

To determine if you have to use unstable or not to build as close as possible certain release, take a look at the files `/etc/lesslinux/updater/version.git` and `/etc/lesslinux/updater/command.sh`. The first file contains the git SHA1 sum that identifies a certain revision und the second contains the stage 3 command.

**Building packages in chroot**

Now packages in the chroot have to be build. LessLinux supports parallel builds (`-t`) and dependency tracking using strace. If you are not adding new packages, turn it off.

To build, simply run: 

`ruby -I. builder.rb -n -l -s 1,3 -t 3 --no-stracalyze`

or 

`ruby -I. builder.rb -n -l -s 1,3 -t 3 --no-stracalyze -u`

**Building the final ISO image**

To build the ISO you have to specify some config paths - you might use modified versions of those config files outside the LessLinux tree - copy the command from `/etc/lesslinux/updater/command.sh` mentioned above:

`ruby -I. builder.rb -n -s 1,2,bootconf \
	-p config/pkglist_neutral_rescue_GTK3.txt \
	--skip-files config/skiplist_neutral_rescue.txt \
	-c config/general_neutral_rescue.xml \
	-b config/branding_neutral_rescue.xml \
	-k config/kernels_rescue_experimental.xml -u`
